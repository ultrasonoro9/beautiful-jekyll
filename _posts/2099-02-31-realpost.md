subtitle: ... inside stories seldom live up to one’s expectations. Usually they are grubby little things, reducing down to the basest of motives when all is known. Conjectures and illusions are often the better possessions." ― Roger Zelazny

First off, welcome! I have wanted to have a place where others can come to learn a little more about the mind of Clifton Capes, this site is a start.

The posts and articles that I write or link to are things that are of interest to me at the time, and that I think may be interesting to someone else. Don't read too much into why I chose to write about something, as you will see the topics are varied and frankly, pretty random.

There is no self written description here where I awkwardly try to explain who I am. Even if I thought I could describe myself, how could you know that what I am saying is truthful? Many project an image that is less a reflection of who they are, and is instead an image of who they feel they need to be to impress others. I'm not immune to that myself, so instead I will write about some things I find interesting at the time, and you can get some kind of idea of how I think.
